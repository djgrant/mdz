# Homepage Copy Revision

## Goal/Problem

Homepage headline ("A language for the world's most powerful runtime") is too abstract. Doesn't pass 3-second test.

**Reference:** See findings in `.opencode/work/completed/wp-2026-01-03-onboarding-ux-audit.md`

## Scope

- `website/src/pages/index.astro`
- Headline and subheadline only

## Guardrail

⚠️ **REQUIRES HUMAN APPROVAL** - Do not update homepage wording without @djgrant review first. Prepare draft options and present for approval before any changes.

## Approach

1. Draft 3 alternative headlines
2. Draft supporting subheadline for each
3. Present options to @djgrant
4. Implement ONLY after explicit approval

**Quick wins from research:**
- Add "who is this for" line
- Lead with benefit, not abstraction

## Hypothesis

Concrete benefit-focused copy will improve first impression.

## Results

{To be filled out upon completion}

## Evaluation

{Did the new copy pass the 3-second test?}
