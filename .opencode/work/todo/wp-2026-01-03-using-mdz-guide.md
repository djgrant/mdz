# "Using MDZ in Your Project" Guide

## Goal/Problem

Documentation explains what MDZ IS but not what to DO with it. No bridge from toy example to real use.

**Reference:** See findings in `.opencode/work/completed/wp-2026-01-03-onboarding-ux-audit.md`

## Scope

- New docs page: `website/src/pages/docs/using-in-project.astro`
- Or extend getting-started

## Approach

1. Define the workflow: write skill → validate → use with agent
2. Show directory structure for skill library
3. Show integration with common tools (Claude, OpenCode, etc.)
4. Provide copy-paste starting point

## Hypothesis

A practical "now use it" guide bridges the gap from playground to adoption.

## Results

{To be filled out upon completion}

## Evaluation

{Can someone follow this guide and actually use MDZ in their project?}
