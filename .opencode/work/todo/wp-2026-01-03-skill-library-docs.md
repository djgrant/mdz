# Document Skill Library Pattern

## Goal/Problem

No guidance on organizing, versioning, or sharing skills. This blocks the "personal skill library" stickiness pattern.

**Reference:** See findings in `.opencode/work/completed/wp-2026-01-03-stickiness-research.md`

## Scope

- New docs page or section

## Approach

1. Recommend directory structure for skills
2. Versioning strategy (git tags? semantic?)
3. Sharing patterns (git repo, npm package?)
4. Team workflow recommendations

## Hypothesis

Clear patterns make MDZ feel like infrastructure, not a one-off tool.

## Results

{To be filled out upon completion}

## Evaluation

{Do users adopt the skill library pattern?}
