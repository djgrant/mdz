# FAQ Section for HN Objections

## Goal/Problem

Need to preempt common objections before HN launch.

**Reference:** See findings in `.opencode/work/completed/wp-2026-01-03-hn-launch-prep.md`

## Scope

- New section in README.md or website

## Approach

Address these anticipated questions:
1. "Why not just use markdown?" 
2. "Isn't this just prompt engineering?"
3. "What about [competitor]?"
4. "Show me something real"
5. "Why would I learn a new syntax?"

## Hypothesis

Proactive FAQ reduces friction and shows we've thought through objections.

## Results

{To be filled out upon completion}

## Evaluation

{Did the FAQ address common concerns in HN comments?}
