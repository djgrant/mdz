# Unit Testing Framework - Phase 1: vitest utilities

## Goal/Problem

Implement the first phase of the testing framework: basic vitest utilities for structural validation.

**Reference:** See scoping in `.opencode/work/completed/wp-2026-01-03-unit-testing-scoping.md`

## Scope

- New package or directory for test utilities
- Integration with vitest

## Approach (from scoping)

Phase 1 deliverables:
- `parsesSuccessfully(source)` - validates MDZ parses without errors
- `hasType(source, typeName)` - checks type definitions exist
- `hasSection(source, sectionName)` - checks sections exist
- `validatesWith(source, options)` - runs full validation

Estimated effort: 1-2 days

## Hypothesis

Basic structural tests provide immediate value with low effort.

## Results

{To be filled out upon completion}

## Evaluation

{Are the utilities useful? What's missing?}
