# Playground Export Button

## Goal/Problem

Playground is a dead end - users can't save or export their work.

**Reference:** See findings in `.opencode/work/completed/wp-2026-01-03-onboarding-ux-audit.md`

## Scope

- `website/src/pages/playground.astro`

## Approach

1. Add "Copy to clipboard" button
2. Add "Download as .mdz" button
3. Consider: "Share as URL" with encoded content?

## Hypothesis

Export options convert playground exploration into real use.

## Results

{To be filled out upon completion}

## Evaluation

{Do users export and use their playground experiments?}
