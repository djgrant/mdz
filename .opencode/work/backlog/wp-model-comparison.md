# Model Comparison Tooling

## Goal/Problem

Compare MDZ skill performance between different LLM models.

**Reference:** ROADMAP.md - Tooling Ideas

## Scope

- Benchmark runner
- Comparison reports

## Approach

1. Define benchmark suite (same skill, multiple models)
2. Metrics: accuracy, token usage, latency, cost
3. Generate comparison reports
4. Identify model-specific issues

## Hypothesis

Comparison data helps users choose models and optimize skills.

## Results

{To be filled out upon completion}

## Evaluation

{Is the comparison actionable? What patterns emerge?}
