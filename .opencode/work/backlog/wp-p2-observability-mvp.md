# Observability/Replay Tool - MVP

## Goal/Problem

Build minimal replay tool for website demo - show test suite execution without LLM costs.

**Reference:** See scoping in `.opencode/work/completed/wp-2026-01-03-observability-scoping.md`

## Scope

- Trace capture format
- Pre-recorded traces
- Simple player component for website

## Approach (from scoping)

MVP scope:
1. Define trace JSON schema
2. Manually capture 2-3 execution traces
3. Build simple step-through player component
4. Embed on website as demo

Estimated effort: 5-7 days for MVP

## Hypothesis

Replay demos are compelling without ongoing LLM costs.

## Results

{To be filled out upon completion}

## Evaluation

{Is the replay compelling? Does it convey value?}
