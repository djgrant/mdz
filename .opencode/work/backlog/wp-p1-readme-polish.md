# README Polish for Launch

## Goal/Problem

README headline doesn't land the value prop in 10 seconds. Need to rewrite opening for clarity.

**Reference:** See findings in `.opencode/work/completed/wp-2026-01-03-hn-launch-prep.md`

## Scope

- `README.md` in project root
- Opening section only

## Guardrail

⚠️ **REQUIRES HUMAN APPROVAL** - Do not merge README changes without @djgrant review. Prepare draft and present for approval.

## Approach

1. Draft 3 alternative opening headlines
2. Draft concise "what is this" paragraph
3. Present options to @djgrant for selection
4. Implement approved version

**Recommended positioning from research:**
> "MDZ: Markdown syntax for building LLM agents - with static analysis to catch errors before runtime"

## Hypothesis

A clearer opening will improve the 3-second comprehension test.

## Results

{To be filled out upon completion}

## Evaluation

{Did the new copy improve comprehension?}
