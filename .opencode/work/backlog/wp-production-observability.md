# Production Observability (Shallow Exploration)

## Goal/Problem

Understand monitoring/debugging needs for MDZ skills in production.

**Reference:** ROADMAP.md - Tooling Ideas

## Scope

- Research only
- Requirements gathering

## Approach

1. What do users need to observe in production?
   - Error rates
   - Latency
   - Token usage
   - Control flow paths taken
2. What existing tools could integrate?
3. What's MDZ-specific vs general LLM observability?

## Hypothesis

Understanding production needs informs tooling priorities.

## Results

{To be filled out upon completion}

## Evaluation

{What's the minimum viable observability story?}
