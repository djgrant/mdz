# OpenCode Integration

## Goal/Problem

MDZ as a first-class authoring format for OpenCode skills.

**Reference:** ROADMAP.md Section 6 - OpenCode Integration

## Scope

- Output structure matching OpenCode conventions
- Grammar preamble for skill loading
- Validation in skill authoring workflow

## Approach

1. Research OpenCode skill format requirements
2. Map MDZ output to expected structure
3. Implement grammar preamble injection (optional)
4. Document integration workflow

## Hypothesis

Native OpenCode integration makes MDZ practical for daily agent work.

## Results

{To be filled out upon completion}

## Evaluation

{Does the integration feel natural? Is there friction?}
