# Interactive Playground Tutorial

## Goal/Problem

People land on playground, don't know what to do. Need guided walkthrough.

**Reference:** ROADMAP.md Section 4 - Playground Reimagining

## Scope

- `website/src/pages/playground.astro`

## Approach

1. Design tutorial flow (5-7 steps?)
2. Highlight UI elements as user progresses
3. Pre-fill examples at each step
4. Track completion state

## Hypothesis

Guided experience improves "aha moment" rate.

## Results

{To be filled out upon completion}

## Evaluation

{Do users complete the tutorial? Do they understand MDZ after?}
