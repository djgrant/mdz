Persistent learning system for review preferences.

## Workflow

### Learn Action

IF $action = "learn" THEN
  Parse $feedback for the preference and why it matters
  Determine scope (file pattern or repo-wide)
  Formulate: "In [scope]: [preference] because [reason]"
  Append to .review/learnings.md with scope and learning entries
END

### Apply Action

IF $action = "apply" THEN
  Read .review/learnings.md if it exists
  FOR $learning IN $learnings
    FOR $path IN $paths
      IF /scope matches path/ THEN
        Add to applicable learnings
      END
    END
  END
  RETURN /applicable learnings/
END

## Bootstrap

On first run, check for guideline files: .cursorrules, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md.

IF /guideline files found/ THEN
  Parse into learnings with repo-wide scope
  Append to .review/learnings.md
END
