Brand Guideline: MDZ

Identity

    Acronym: MDZ

    Full Name: ZenMarkdown

    File Extension: .mdz

Why "MDZ"? (The Strategy)

    Developer Recognition: The phonetics mirror MDX (Markdown + JSX), instantly signaling to developers that this is "Markdown with executable logic."

    Discoverability: "Zen" is a saturated keyword (Python, AMD, MLOps). "MDZ" is a unique identifier that makes the documentation and tools easy to find via search engines.

Why "Zen"? (The Philosophy)

    Signal over Noise: Standard prompts are often cluttered with verbose instructions to manage context. "Zen" refers to the removal of this linguistic clutter.

    Clarity of Thought: By offloading logic, variables, and structure to the syntax (the .mdz file), the final prompt sent to the LLM is clean and focused. The code handles the complexity so the model can focus on the intent.
