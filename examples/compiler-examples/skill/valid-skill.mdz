description: When orchestrating hypothesis-driven iteration

types:
  $Hypothesis: /a testable prediction about what will solve the problem/
  $Result: "confirmed" | "refuted" | "inconclusive"

input:
  $problem: $String
  $maxIterations: $Number = 5

context:
  $hypothesis: $Hypothesis
  $result: $Result
  $iteration: 0
---

## Workflow

WHILE NOT /diminishing returns/ AND $iteration < $maxIterations DO:
  - Formulate $hypothesis based on $problem
  - Design experiment to test $hypothesis
  - USE ~/skill/work-packages TO /execute experiment/
  - Evaluate $result from experiment
  - IF $result = "confirmed" THEN:
    - Commit changes
  - Increment $iteration
