description: When orchestrating hypothesis-driven iteration
uses:
  - work-packages
---

## Types

$Hypothesis: /a testable prediction about what will solve the problem/
$Result: "confirmed" | "refuted" | "inconclusive"

## Input

- $problem: $String
- $maxIterations: $Number = 5

## Context

- $hypothesis: $Hypothesis
- $result: $Result
- $iteration = 0

## Workflow

WHILE NOT /diminishing returns/ AND $iteration < $maxIterations DO:
  - Formulate $hypothesis based on $problem
  - Design experiment to test $hypothesis
  - Execute experiment using [[work-packages]]
  - Evaluate $result from experiment
  - IF $result = "confirmed" THEN:
    - Commit changes
  - Increment $iteration
